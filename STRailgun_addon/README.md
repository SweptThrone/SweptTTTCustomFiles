# Traitor Railgun
This addon adds a simple railgun available for traitors to buy in TTT.  
The railgun takes the form of a cyan-tinted Scout sniper rifle.  
It charges up for about two seconds then fires an electric explosive bolt.  
It carries three rounds and cannot reload.
The sounds in this repository are found in this unlisted Workshop addon:
