# CMS - Custom Music System
This addon provides a means for your players to add their own music that is played at the end and beginning of TTT rounds.  
It requires a lot of setup from the end user, so this may not be a popular choice.  
To "enable" end-round and start-round music, each players has to do a bit of manual work.  
Create a folder named sweptttt within your garrysmod/sound/ folder, and put any of the following files in it:  
round_warmup_long.wav - Plays during first-round prep  
round_warmup_short.wav - Plays during other prep  
traitors_win_traitor.wav - Plays when traitors win, and you're a traitor  
traitors_win_innocent.wav - Plays when traitors win, and you're an innocent  
innocent_win_traitor.wav - Plays when innocent win, and you're a traitor  
innocent_win_innocent.wav - Plays when innocent win, and you're an innocent  
round_start_innocent.wav - Plays when you become an innocent  
round_start_traitor.wav - Plays when you become a traitor  
round_start_detective.wav - Plays when you become a detective
