# FLS - Fair Loadout System
This addon allows players to take the weapons they had at the end of a TTT round into the next round as long as they survived.  
You're encouraged to enable the post-round deathmatch so that players can actually fight to keep their weapons.  
This addon does not allow players to save traitor or detective weapons.
