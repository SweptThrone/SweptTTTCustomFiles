# SweptTTTCustomFiles
Various custom files used on my TTT server for Garry's Mod.  Feel free to pick and choose among these files.  
Read the comments at the top of each file to know what it does.  
All of these files can be either dropped into an addon folder or your lua fodler, though this is discouraged.
