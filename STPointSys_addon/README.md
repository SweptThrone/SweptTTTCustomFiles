# PAS - Point Accumulation System
This addon takes the points that are calculated and awarded at the end of TTT rounds and stores them.  
What you do with them from there is up to you, and this addon provides functions to transact these points.  
These points are a vanilla TTT thing and more are awarded the more cleanly you play a round.
